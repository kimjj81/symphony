# Symphony Elixir

This directory contains the Elixir agent orchestration service that polls Linear, creates per-issue workspaces, and runs Codex in app-server mode.

## Environment

- Elixir: `1.19.x` (OTP 28) via `mise`.
- Install deps: `mix setup`.
- Main quality gate: `make all` (format check, lint, coverage, dialyzer).


## Codebase-Specific Conventions

- Runtime config is loaded from `WORKFLOW.md` front matter via `SymphonyElixir.Workflow` and `SymphonyElixir.Config`.
- Keep the implementation aligned with [`../SPEC.md`](../SPEC.md) where practical.
  - The implementation may be a superset of the spec.
  - The implementation must not conflict with the spec.
  - If implementation changes meaningfully alter the intended behavior, update the spec in the same
    change where practical so the spec stays current.
- Prefer adding config access through `SymphonyElixir.Config` instead of ad-hoc env reads.
- Workspace safety is critical:
  - Never run Codex turn cwd in source repo.
  - Workspaces must stay under configured workspace root.
- Orchestrator behavior is stateful and concurrency-sensitive; preserve retry, reconciliation, and cleanup semantics.
- Simplicity is a project constraint: prefer the smallest coherent design with one clear owner and
  invariant. Push back on extra abstractions, duplicated policy, and speculative flexibility.
- For stateful changes, check startup, reload, restart, and failure recovery together before editing.
- Follow `docs/logging.md` for logging conventions and required issue/session context fields.

## Tests and Validation

Run targeted tests while iterating, then run full gates before handoff.

- Prefer narrow tests that exercise real OTP processes and observable behavior over mock-only or
  broad end-to-end coverage; prove health with a synchronous call or stable effect, not only a PID.
- For non-trivial changes, use an adversarial review early to challenge complexity and try to break
  adjacent lifecycle paths; a reproducible failure blocks landing even if other reviews are clean.
- If tests need repeated global restarts or bespoke cleanup, first fix the shared harness or
  ownership boundary.

```bash
make all
```

## Required Rules

- Public functions (`def`) in `lib/` must have an adjacent `@spec`.
- `defp` specs are optional.
- `@impl` callback implementations are exempt from local `@spec` requirement.
- Evaluate proposed directions instead of agreeing reflexively; surface simpler designs and material
  trade-offs early.
- Keep changes narrowly scoped; avoid unrelated refactors.
- Follow existing module/style patterns in `lib/symphony_elixir/*`.

Validation command:

```bash
mix specs.check
```

## PR Requirements

- PR body must follow `../.github/pull_request_template.md` exactly.
- Default GitHub PR merges to squash merge.
- Before updating a remote PR branch, fetch `origin/main` and rebase the current branch onto
  `origin/main`; resolve conflicts locally, then update the remote branch with
  `git push --force-with-lease`.
- Use a merge commit only when the PR body explicitly requests one.
- Validate PR body locally when needed:

```bash
mix pr_body.check --file /path/to/pr_body.md
```

## Docs Update Policy

If behavior/config changes, update docs in the same PR:

- `../README.md` for project concept and goals.
- `README.md` for Elixir implementation and run instructions.
- `WORKFLOW.md` for workflow/config contract changes.

## Graphify Maintenance

These rules apply only to Symphony's Elixir-based orchestration and management
code. Do not propagate them to implementation changes in repositories managed by
Symphony, such as myven itself.

If the `graphify` skill is unavailable in the current session, ignore this
section and continue the work.

When `graphify` is available, update the graph with `/graphify . --update` or
with the current Elixir work scope when:

- Before a large structural change, the `/graphify query` result seems stale
  before touching a new area.
- After a large structural change affects module boundaries, major
  functions/classes, routes, workers, APIs, or deployment scripts.
- After adding or changing docs, ADRs, or plans that materially affect
  architecture graph interpretation.
- Before creating a PR, when reviewers or the next agent should start from the
  same structure map.
- Immediately after merging a branch, when multiple PRs changed relationships
  significantly.

Graphify updates are auxiliary context refreshes. They do not replace required
validation such as `make all`, `mix specs.check`, or PR body checks.
